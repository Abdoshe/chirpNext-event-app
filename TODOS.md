# TODOS

1. Minimize KSD verification requests

2. Remove any `console.log` statements

3. Remove static `window.location` changes use template strings for server-side route changes

5. Allow creation of `ROUTINES` for Events. 
_Eg: A class from 10:00 AM - 12 noon every Monday without the organizer having to create it manually every Monday._
