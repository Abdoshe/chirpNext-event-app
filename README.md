3. While in the project root directory, run the development server script using `npm run dev`.
4. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you will see the app entry point.
5. Use a <username@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in> e-mail (no auth included yet, but for regex tests) and a password with over 8 chars.
